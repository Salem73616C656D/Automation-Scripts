# Class-Scripts
This repository is a conglomeration of all the scripts I've written as part of the Code Fellows Ops/Cybersecurity program.

  I plan on using the skills I gather from writing and editing these scripts to enter the cybersecurity workforce, and to be be a more efficient security practitioner.

  As I've made progress in the Ops 201 portion of the course I've developed some fundamental langauge skills in both PowerShell, and BASH. I've particularly enjoyed learning how to use BASH to pull login activity from my machine (allyourbase.sh) and then also to pull domain information from a specific domain (ddigger.sh).

  The fundamentals from the scripts I've written I feel will be very useful when in the role of a cybersecurity practitioner to access various information across both Linux and Windows systems. Having access to domain, login, and system information can be very useful when diagnosing issues that a machine or user is having.
	
  I believe that in general my PowerShell scripting needs more work, but I do believe that through the next two sections of this course I will definitley hone these skills.
